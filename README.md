# COMP9444-Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning

 Alan is the lecturer of this semester and this course is quite interesting. I can fell Alan is happy during his teaching, because he always smiles in the lecture. The lecture is a little difficult to understand because there are many math equations, but they are very important(espcially for the final exam). After learning this course, I think I make a huge progress in reading math equations  -_-.     Overall, this course is good. It teaches many architectures and designs in neural network. The class assignments can be hard for novice, but after good comprehending of each architecture, things become easy. By the way, the final exam is not difficult.
